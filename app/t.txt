If i fill out the fields for the address section and leave the fields for the contact info empty,
it will render 'an error occur, please try again'. This should render specific messages for what fields are required.
I should not need to refresh the page myself to see the created customer. If i leave the display name field empty when creating a new customer,
it will not render the link to edit that customer. Bug with deleting a customer, I was able to delete a few customers then unable to delete a few.
